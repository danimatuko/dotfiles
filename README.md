# 🛠️ Dotfiles

A collection of my personal configuration files to quickly bootstrap a modern development environment on Arch Linux (Hyprland-based).

---

## 📦 Included Configurations

This repository includes settings and scripts for:

* **Bash** — Modular `bashrc` with `starship`, `zoxide`, `fzf`, etc.
* **Tmux** — Minimal terminal multiplexer setup
* **Git** — Git identity and general preferences
* **Hyprland** — Wayland window manager configuration
* **Kitty / Ghostty** — Terminal emulators with matching themes
* **Neovim (AstroNvim)** — Fully-featured NVim configuration with lazy-loading plugins
* **Waybar** — Custom status bar setup
* **Rofi** — Themed app launcher with icon and font support
* **SwayNC** — Notification center
* **Bluetooth / Audio / Network** — Helpers and GUI tools (`blueman`, `pavucontrol`, etc.)
* **Custom Scripts** — Located in `scripts/`, symlinked automatically

---

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Clone the repo using a shallow clone (faster download):

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/danimatuko/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Run the modular install script:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

> 🛟 The script automatically installs `yay`, backs up existing configs, and prompts before linking.

---

## 🔗 How Linking Works

The script will:

1. Create a timestamped backup (e.g. `~/dotfiles_backup_2025-07-11_15-32-00`)
2. Prompt to confirm linking your `.bashrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `.gitconfig`, and config folders
3. Use symlinks (`ln -sf`) so updates can be version-controlled and shared easily

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Tips

* **Check if configs are linked**:

  ```bash
  ls -la ~/.config/
  ```

* **Check backups**:
  Look inside the `~/dotfiles_backup_<timestamp>` directory.

* **Re-run just the link script**:

  ```bash
  bash ~/dotfiles/link-dotfiles.sh
  ```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Based on **Arch Linux**
* The installer handles installing `yay` (AUR helper) if missing
* Designed for a **Wayland + Hyprland** setup
* Includes optional scripts for font, icon, and clipboard support
