## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Link Executable Scripts

```bash
./link-bin-scripts.sh
```

This links all executable files in `bin/` to `~/.local/bin`, making them available in your `$PATH`.

### 2. Link and Enable systemd Units

```bash
./link-systemd-units.sh
```

This will:
- Symlink service/timer units to `~/.config/systemd/user/`
- Reload the systemd user daemon
- Enable and start all units

## 🧼 Additional Utilities

- `reload-waybar.sh`, `reload-swaync.sh`: Reload system components  
- `screenshot-*.sh`: Take various types of screenshots  
- `set-wallpaper-colors.sh`, `update-waybar-colors.sh`: Sync Pywal colors with UI elements  
- `pywal-theme.sh`: Triggered via Waypaper to update themes dynamically  
- `waypaper-update-theme.sh`: Updates wallpaper and related themes  
- `update-notifier.sh` A minimal notifier that uses `checkupdates` to count available system updates and sends a simple desktop notification.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

- `checkupdates` (from `pacman-contrib`)  
- `notify-send` (provided by `libnotify`)  
- A notification daemon like swaync  
- `systemd --user` support  

---

## 📎 Notes

- All scripts are written to be simple, modular, and easy to extend.  
- Place this folder inside your dotfiles repo (e.g. `~/dotfiles/scripts`).  
- Recommended to run both `link-bin-scripts.sh` and `link-systemd-units.sh` after cloning your dotfiles on a new machine.
